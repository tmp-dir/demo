## What am i doing

approaching this with exponential compounding and lin reg. representing a future as $F=Se^{-rT} \implies \frac{\log{\frac{S}{F}}}{T} = r$. this should basically pull it into a linear space. justification here is that the term structure for available crypto futures are basically 1 week to 6 months

I'm making assumptions about the data being pulled in as well. calculating instantaneous rates off of a nebulous price. almost certainly going to want some better feed in here, some depth weighted pricing or averaged through time or both. Also there's no real expiry conditions, ripping out an implied rate close to expiry will cause the implied rate to become huge. 

Similarly no adj for exchange to exchange, there's likely going to be systematic adjustments that need to be made between exchanges to properly handle the differences.

I'm not doing any regularisation or anything, so one junk value generated by above can seriously start to warp the results.

also trying to keep this fast which is probably not that relevant if the primary usecase is some slow-loop system. it can just churn out a surface on request then.

doing some lin reg stuff. tried to make it a bit more fun and minimise updates. can do that by splitting up into some $s_x$, $s_y$, $s_{xx}$, $s_{xy}$ and on demand ripping out the coeff from these bits in the `get_coeff` fn of the model class. issues here are that spot price and tte are used in the calculations and they will change independently. Going to assume that T is approx const, with sufficient updates to the future, this should be fine.

to handle the spot updates, I can split out the necessary params further and just compute the spot part when the rate is requested. Math here (F= future, S = spot, T = tte, r= implied rate):


$$s_x = \Sigma T_i$$.
$$s_y = \Sigma r_i = \Sigma [\frac{\log{S}}{T_i} - \frac{\log{F_i}{T_i}}]$$
$$ = \log{S} \Sigma \frac{1}{T_i} - \Sigma \frac{F_i}{T_i} $$

so can just track the T_i and F_i / T_i sum and reconstitute.

$$s_xx = \Sigma T_i^2$$

$$s_xy = \Sigma r_i T_i = \Sigma [ \log{S} - \log{F_i} ] = n \log{S} - \Sigma \log{F_i} $$

so here just need to track the sum of the log futures.

combines and returns that.


## Usage

this will probably get it compiling, if fetch is installed.

    mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
    cmake --build . && ./YieldCurve_Tests

otherwise check out main.cpp && model.hpp.
